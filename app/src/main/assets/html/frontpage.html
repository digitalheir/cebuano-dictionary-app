<h1>Cebuano Dictionary for Android</h1>

<p>To search, enter a Cebuano word in the search box.

<p>This dictionary uses a phonetic spelling of Cebuano. This differs from the normal spelling used
in Cebuano publications. The letter <i>o</i> is always spelled as <i>u</i> and <i>e</i> is always 
spelled as <i>i</i>. The search takes this in account, so you can type words as you are used to in
the normal way. Spanish and English loan-words are always written as pronounced by Cebuano speakers.
Please read the introduction to this dictionary for more details on spelling and other features of
this dictionary.

<p>The settings screen allows you to change your preferences. You can change the font-size, the
presentation of articles and the expansion of abbreviated forms. The reverse-lookup option is
experimental. The source dictionary was made to look-up Cebuano words and find their meaning in
English.

<p>The content of this app is taken from <i>A Dictionary of Cebuano Visayan</i> by John U. Wolff.
