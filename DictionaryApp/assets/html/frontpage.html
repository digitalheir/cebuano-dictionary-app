<h1>Cebuano Dictionary for Android</h1>

<p style="color: red"><b>This is pre-release software under development, and may contain many bugs!</b> Please contact 
<a href="mailto:jeroen@bohol.ph">Jeroen Hellingman</a> if you have remarks, comments, or bug-reports.

<p>To search, enter a Cebuano word in the search box.

<p>This dictionary uses a strictly phonetic spelling of Cebuano. This differs from the orthography normally used
in Cebuano publications. The letter <i>o</i> is always spelled as <i>u</i> and <i>e</i> is always 
spelled as <i>i</i>. The search takes this in account. Spanish and English loan-words are always written as pronounced
by Cebuano speakers. Please read the introduction for more details on spelling and other features of this 
dictionary.

<p>The settings screen allows you to change your preferences. You can change the font-size, as well as the 
presentation of articles and expansion of abbreviated forms. When you use the reverse lookup option, please realize this
dictionary was made to look-up Cebuano words, not English words.

<p>The content is based on <i>A Dictionary of Cebuano Visayan</i> by John U. Wolff. The full text of this dictionary
is available from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40074">Project Gutenberg</a>. A free searchable online 
version is available on <a href="http://www.bohol.ph/wced.php">www.Bohol.ph</a>.
